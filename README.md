main.py - Creates the neural network using premade data
makedata.py - Creates said data using the lichess.com online database
modelaccuracy.py - Checks the accuracy of a model
modelprediction.py - Takes a premade model and a chess position and predicts the next best move
neuralnetwork.py - Defines my training procedure and the architecture of each model
