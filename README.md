This is my thesis. Below are the important pieces and what they do. <br />
chessfunctions.py - Contains every algorithm I made involving the board and collecting data <br />
main.py - Creates the neural network using premade data <br />
makedata.py - Creates said data using the lichess.com online database <br />
modelaccuracy.py - Checks the accuracy of a model <br />
modelprediction.py - Takes a premade model and a chess position and predicts the next best move <br />
neuralnetwork.py - Defines my training procedure and the architecture of each model <br />
